## College Studies Helper - Quiz and Flash Cards generator

### Problem Description
 - Often students might find difficulties in accessing enough relevant study material, or precise notes for examination.
 - Additionally, it is a challenging task itself to create a coherent set of practice exercises.
### Solution Proposed 
 - We propose a novel approach to finding relevant study material, based on the traditional way of studying. 
 - Our application can generate quick reference notes, formulae sheets, syntax cheat sheets or other forms of reference materials on the go, given the syllabus, for a variety of subjects ranging from mathematics to getting a good history lesson. 
 - Based on chosen difficulty levels, a student can also generate quizzes and exercises to help practice better before examination. 
 - Both difficulty and scope of questions will be configurable so that the application can be used at multiple levels of study.
 - Extra features: Math Solver, Presentation Practice.
